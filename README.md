# TimeReverse-1
Unity project showing time reversal interaction in virtual reality (oculus)

Open this project in Unity 5.6.1f1

It uses the OVR Oculus VR plugin, so it is only compatible with Oculus at the moment but you could adapt it to run on Vive.

The spacebar causes an explosion in the virtual environment, and then you can use the left Oculus Touch controller to control 
time by pressing "A" button and moving the controller left and right.
